Luncher - an app that creates random groups (e.g. for company lunch outings) with a user-set list of names
(Written with Meteor)

Default is currently set to divide the Yipit team (www.yipit.com/about/team) into 3 groups. Other names can be added to the randomizer as well.

To run:

-Locally: cd into the project folder and in the terminal run 'meteor'. The default should be localhost:3000</li>
-Deploy: cd into the project folder and in the terminal run 'meteor deploy <name>'. This will deploy it to name.meteor.com</li>
